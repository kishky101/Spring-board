        "courseIntro": "To all Muslims regardless of their ages and cultural backgrounds, knowledge of Qur’an is obligatory. They need to be able to read the Qur’an as perfect as possible in their daily Salat. Therefore, application of rules of Tajwid is equally binding on every Muslim to enable them read the Quran correctly. To make the implementation possible, Muslims need to understand the meaning of the Noble Qur’an, hence the need for the knowledge of Tafsir. To achieve these goals, knowledge of the Arabic language is very key. Therefore, at Springboard Language Academy, priority is given to the knowledge of Qur’an in terms of reading, and understanding the meaning. In addition to that, most Arabic and Islamic Sciences revolve round the knowledge of the Qur’an."

        "courseIntro": "The Hadith, which connotes the saying and practices of the Noble Prophet (SAW), is the second major source of Islamic Shariah. Written originally in Arabic, learning the Hadith will serve two purposes for whoever is interested in learning Arabic; it strengthens their Arabic vocabulary base and also broadens their knowledge of major Islamic science."

        "iconClass": faScaleBalanced,
        "courseIntro": "Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) is the knowledge of extracting of laws and in-depth understanding of Islamic laws. Scholars of Islam have done a lot in this regard and various schools of thoughts have emerged with little divergent opinions. Also written in Arabic, learning Fiqh will also enrich the vocabularies of Arabic learning."

        "courseIntro": "Even though any text written in Arabic is Arabiyyah, the word is used in this context to connote the four language skills namely: reading, speaking, writing and listening. For this job, we have adopted a series that will take our course participants through the process of learning all these skills. "

        "courseName": "Qawaid Lughati-l-Arabiyyah (Nahw Sarf)",
        "iconClass": faBookOpenReader,
        "courseIntro": "Knowledge of Arabic Grammar is highly essential in learning the language. The language is largely derivative in nature which makes it so dynamic that it can accommodate so many new innovations with minimal borrowing from other language. From a root word, one can derive so many other others using the knowledge of Sarf (morphology). On the other hand, Nahw (Syntax) is a twin sister of Sarf and particular about the vowel at the tail end of each word. Mere of a wrong vowel at the end of a particular word can change the meaning to the opposite of what one intends to say. Therefore, a learner of Arabic language should exercise caution while reading an Arabic text especially the Qur’an so that he will not end up changing the content of the Noble book. Furthermore, this knowledge is essential in understanding the Arabic text."
